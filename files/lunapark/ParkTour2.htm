      <p>Directly ahead is the lagoon. The <i>Scenitorium</i> is on the left 
        in the picture; the <i>Japanese Exposition</i> is on the right. Directly behind the lagoon, you can see the Band shell.  Behind the Band Shell is the <i>Chutes</i> ride. </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="lagoon.jpg" width="451" height="285"></p>
      <p>Walking down the right side of the lagoon you would pass a series of 
        buildings forming the <i>Japanese Exposition</i>.  The entire structure 
        was of elaborate oriental design and illuminated with Japanese lanterns.  
        Here a dozen Geisha girls performed dances, a tea garden served refreshments, 
        and a wide variety of oriental curios were sold by Japanese ladies dressed 
        in authentic costumes. </p>

      <p>Walking down the left side of the lagoon you would first see the metal 
        spire of Harry Traver’s <i>Great Aerial Swing</i> circle swing ride. The cars on the ride were in the shape of fanciful balloon gondolas (after the Great War, the cars would be changed to look like fighter biplanes, and the ride renamed the <i>Airplane Swing</i>).</p>		      
      <p align="center"><img src="gondola_small.jpg" width="528" height="318"></p>
      <p>Next to the circle swing, and surrounded by a plaster mountain, was the 
        popular fun house <i>Chateau Alphonse</i>, which incorporated a stall selling 
        cold drinks. </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="chateau.jpg" width="523" height="420"></p>
      <p> Beside the fun house was the <i>Old Shoe</i> giant slide in the shape 
        of a shoe.  Painted on the wall of the building 
        next to the shoe were scenes from nursery rhymes such as the cow jumping 
        over the moon.  </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="shoe.jpg" width="428" height="271"></p>
      <p>The building to the right of the slide was known as the <i>EDISONIA</i>.  
        This was an early version of what is now commonly called the "penny arcade."  
        Inside were machines, where among other things, people could listen to 
        phonograph recordings or view kinetoscope movies.  Beside the <i>EDISONIA</i> 
        were the park offices.  </p>
		<p>In the picture below, we are looking at the same buildings as the above pictures, taken at a distance.  From left to right we see the <i>Scenetorium</i>, the <i>Aerial Swing</i>, the fun house <i>Chateau Alphonse</i>, and the <i>Old Shoe</i>.</p>
