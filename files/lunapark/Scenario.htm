<tr><td><p align="center">Playing the Scenario</p>
      <p>It is the 18<sup>th</sup> of May, 1905.  You have been retained by Frederick 
        Ingersoll to run his new Luna Park, and you have problems.  Building two large parks over the same winter has taxed his resources, but now it's up to you.</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="ingersoll.jpg" width="368" height="460"></p>
	  <p align="center"><img src="ScenarioEntrance.jpg" width="620" height="419"></p>		
      <p>You have been running advertisements stating that Cleveland’s Luna Park 
        would open on schedule, and you have met your commitment.</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="advertisement.jpg" width="642" height="366"></p>
	  <p>However, the Circus Ring is not quite finished, and the Great Aerial 
        Swing is a long way from being finished.  You are lucky to have over $50,000 
        in cash, but you are also holding a $60,000 debt.  Your responsibility 
        will now be to hire staff and add amenities, so you can pay off your debt 
        and increase the parks value to the investors.  </p>
      <p>On the plus side of the ledger, you have a number of attractions that 
        are ready to go. Most of the action is centered around the lagoon, which 
        was built at the end of the midway.</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="ScenarioLagoon.jpg" width="620" height="416"></p> 
      <p>REALISM CONSIDERATIONS:  You should try to avoid demolishing the landmark 
        arch or the trolley loop (trolleys lasted a long time in Cleveland).  
        You should also try not to demolish the Scenic River ride (which wasn’t 
        even compromised to accommodate the <i>Jack Rabbit</i> coaster, built in 1915).  Some 
        years into the scenario you should give serious consideration to adding 
        a dedicated parking lot on the property. </p>

      <p>The <a href="ParkLaterImprovements.htm">Later Improvements to the park</a> 
        page gives some guidance on how the park evolved, if you wish to model 
        its development while playing the scenario.</p>
