<tr><td><p align="center">Park History</p>
<p>When someone mentions amusement park chains today, one tends to 
  think of "Six Flags", "Cedar Fair" or "Paramount".  But the idea of a park chain 
  is nothing new.  At the turn of the last century there was a huge international 
  amusement park chain known as "Luna" which consisted of dozens of member parks, 
  more than the current holdings of "Six Flags", "Cedar Fair", "Paramount", "Anheuser-Busch", 
  and "Walt Disney" <i>combined</i>!  One could find a Luna Park virtually anywhere 
  in the world, such as in Coney Island New York, Berlin Germany, Cairo Egypt, 
  and Takarazuka Japan.  [TRIVIA: a least one Luna Park <a href="http://www.lunaparksydney.com/luna_park_sydney/Luna_Park_Home/History/history.html" target="_blank">still exists</a> in Sydney Australia.]</p>
<p>Of all the parks in the chain, the best was the Luna 
  Park in Cleveland 
  Ohio (as a testament to its popularity, you 
  can regularly find postcards of the park being auctioned over the internet).  
  The park was in fact so well respected, that for many years other park builders 
  across the United States 
  would visit just to study its layout and operation.  Cleveland’s 
  Luna Park 
  was built by Frederick Ingersoll over the winter of 
  1904/05, the same winter he built a similar, but short lived, park in Pittsburgh 
  Pennsylvania.  [TRIVIA: <a href="http://www.kennywood.com/lost2k.htm" target="_blank">"Kennywood Park"</a>
  pays tribute to Pittsburgh’s Luna Park with their <i>Lost Kennywood</i> 
  theme area]. </p>
<p>The park was built on approximately 31 acres of land on Cleveland’s East Side, bordered by Woodhill Road, Woodland Avenue, Ingersoll Road (now Mt. Carmel), and Ferncliff (now E. 110<sup>th</sup> 
  Street). </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="map.jpg" width="500" height="727"></p>
  <p>The land was financed for $60,000 at 5% interest, and a group of investors 
  raised $300,000 to construct the park.  The neighborhood was middle class, semi-residential, 
  and serviced by major transit arteries.  The residents were initially of a mixed 
  central European ethnicity, but by the Great War the area had evolved into a 
  major Italian community.  </p>
<p>Prior to the grand opening on 18 May 1905, Cleveland 
  was flooded with promotional materials, and advertisements in newspapers such 
  as the Cleveland <i>Plain Dealer</i>.  This was necessary because there were 
  many nearby amusement parks to take away customers, such as "Euclid 
  Beach Park" 
  and the nearly completed and quite lavish "White 
  City" (Cleveland 
  was at the time the sixth largest city in the United 
  States, and the choices of entertainment venues 
  reflected this).  Luna Park 
  differed from Euclid Beach 
  Park in that Luna charged for both 
  admission and rides (Euclid Beach 
  charged only for rides).  Euclid Beach 
  was also a <i>dry</i> park, whereas Luna served beer at both the Café Napoleon 
  and Rooftop Garden Restaurant (located on the upper floor of the Casino).  Luna 
  Park differed from (the jinxed) White City in that White City was painted all 
  white, whereas Luna was painted in a rainbow of pinks, greens yellows, oranges, 
  blues, and purples.  Luna Park 
  was open until midnight, and every structure was outlined in more than sixty-thousand colored light bulbs. A popular advertising slogan was "It’s Never Dark at Luna 
  Park".</p>
<p>Although builders had worked feverishly, the park was not fully complete on 
  opening day.  The free open-air circus ring was not finished until two days 
  later, and the Great Aerial Swing would not be ready until the middle of July. 
  None-the-less, opening day was a rousing success, which included fireworks, 
  band concerts, and even a spine-tingling (this was 1905 remember) free act featuring 
  a lady leaping across a chasm in an automobile!</p>
