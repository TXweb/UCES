      <p align="center">A First Year Tour of Cleveland’s Luna Park (page 1 of 
        3) </p>
      <p>This aerial overview was taken after 1905, but provides an orientation 
        of the entire park. Locate the oval shaped lagoon at the left in the picture. It is a focal point of the park. Notice the walking bridge over the lagoon at the far left of the picture. This is the "back" of the park. </p>
      <p>Just behind the lagoon on the left is the plaza. Pagoda style buildings 
        of the <i>Japanese Exposition</i> are adjacent to the plaza. In front 
        of the lagoon are attractions that were built after 1905, including the 
        Ferris Wheel.</p>
      <p>To the right of the lagoon is the midway. The stairs to enter the park 
        are on the far right. The baseball field is in the upper right corner of the picture.</p>

      <p>The entrance: Guests arrived at Luna from Ingersoll Road.  Those arriving by automobile 
        (Cleveland was at the time a major automobile manufacturing center) parked 
        on the street or in the field on the corner 
        of Ingersoll and Woodhill Road (in later years the grounds inside the 
        park on the opposite side of the tall board fence would be used as a parking 
        lot). </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="open_field_small.jpg" width="543" height="254"></p>
      <p>This field, being outside the park fence, was often used to host professional 
        baseball games as a promotional to attract visitors to Luna (this fence 
        also hosted advertising billboards that provided some added revenue for 
        the park).  Most visitors came by Trolley however, and a special layover 
        loop and depot was built above the field on the grounds just below the 
        entrance staircase.  Cleveland had a fabulous trolley system, and several 
        major lines passed alongside the Luna Park property.</p>

<p>After paying an entrance admission (you also had to pay separately for each 
  ride, although in later years Luna would be one of the first parks to offer 
  an optional combination "pay one price" ticket for entrance/unlimited-rides), 
  you were faced with a climb of three flights of stairs to get from the bottom 
  of the ravine to the top where the majority of the park resided.  Soon Luna 
  would cover the stairs and replace the lower staircase with 
  one of the earliest examples of a moving staircase (escalator) to help ease 
  the climb.</p>
  <p>At the top of the stairs you were greeted with a huge landmark archway 
  over 150 feet wide, topped by obelisks and a giant crescent moon (the moon was 
  the Luna chains trademark).  The archway was painted in bright white and gold, 
  and illuminated by ten thousand electric lights.  An illuminated sign read "Ingersoll’s Luna Park", and on the opposite side of the arch 
  was an illuminated heart-shaped sign that read "Good Night".  </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="landmark_arch_small.jpg" width="536" height="292"></p>
<p>Once through the archway you entered the main midway, in the heart of the park below 
  the lagoon. To the immediate left of the archway was Luna Parks 
        well regarded Café.  Next to the Café were a series of shops and entertainments, 
        such as the <i>Arcadia</i> fun house and the exotic <i>Candy Butcher Shop</i>.  
        At the "butcher shop" white-aproned attendants sold sausages, hot dogs, 
        ham sandwiches, pork chops, cheeses, and other items from glass cases, 
        every one of which was made from carefully formed and colored candy!  
        Luna was expected to be different, and even the food concessions lived 
        up to this image.  This part of the midway was situated at an angle, but 
        turned to a normal alignment with the remainder of the park.</p>
      <p>After the turn in the midway came more shops and entertainments, including 
        a .22 caliber <i>Rifle Range</i> (shooting gallery) and the <i>Scenitorium</i>, a motion picture theater that also 
        hosted vaudeville acts and chorus girl shows. The large tower at the end of the structure housed the <i>Taffy Shop </i>(selling taffy, popcorn, and other treats that could be easily carried home on a streetcar). 
      <p>Sometime after opening day, in the center of the midway at the base of 
        the lagoon, a massive kiosk listing the day’s 
        entertainments such as concert schedules was completed.</p>
