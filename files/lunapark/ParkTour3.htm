      <p align="center">A First Year Tour of Cleveland’s Luna Park (page 3 of 
        3) </p>
      <p>The <i>Chutes</i> boats were loaded and splashed down into the lagoon 
        from the 350 foot long ramp, passing under the lagoon bridge. The twin 
        towered building hosted entertainments such as the <i>Electric Theater</i> 
        (initially hosting a show called "the Spectacle of Mt. Pelee", a simulated 
        historical volcano eruption).  </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="incubators_small.jpg" width="540" height="303"></p>
     <p>At the far end of the lagoon was a bridge spanning the Chutes ramp and 
        a large elaborately decorated concert shell.  To the left of the lagoon 
        is where you loaded/exited from the Chutes, and to the right were benches 
        where people could sit and listen to band concerts.  </p>
      <p>In the picture below, the large Moorish styled building at the edge of 
        the plaza is a ballroom called the <i>Casino</i>.  On the upper floor 
        was located the <i>Roof Garden</i> restaurant.  Luna Park became so popular 
        that the dance hall became too small to host the crowds. </p>
      <p>Just to the left of the Casino, is the <i>Scenic River</i>.  This was 
        an "old mill" (tunnel of love) ride that lasted intact throughout the 
        entire life of the park (although at the very end the entrance building 
        was re-designed and the ride renamed the <i>Mystic Caverns</i>).  The 
        station featured a real working waterwheel (the wheel was mounted to the 
        wall that separated the ride station from Luna’s carpentry shop in the 
        rear of the building). Buildings along the course of the ride housed elaborate 
        dioramas.</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="casino.jpg" width="523" height="420"></p>
      <p>Walking past the Scenic River we encounter the <i>Figure 
        Eight</i>.  This held the record as the world’s largest figure eight 
        styled side-friction roller coaster (which isn’t saying much, as Lakemont 
        Parks <i>Leap-the-Dips</i> wasn’t much smaller). </p>

	  <p>The picture below was taken from end of the lagoon, looking towards the 
        midway and the front of the park. You can see the railings of the lagoon 
        bridge in the foreground. The plaza is on the left, with the <i>Japanese Exposition</i> just behind it.</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="midway_from_lagoon_cropped.jpg" width="661" height="451"></p>	  	  		
      <p>The picture below provides a view of the plaza, with the circus ring 
        in the foreground. The Bandshell is behind the lagoon bridge. Between 
        the Chutes ramp and the complementary twin towered building were located 
        the park's main toilets.  Inside the left tower was the small <i>Art Parlor</i> 
        (initially featuring a risqué "girlie" show called the "Parisian Diorama").  
      </p>
      <p>The center building, covered in an elaborate mural, was the <i>Night 
        and Morning</i> theater.  The right tower featured a Hot Waffle shop (the 
        waffles were similar to what would eventually be called "Belgian" waffles).  
      </p>
      <p>Moving along to the right you encounter a building designed to look like 
        the deck of a sailing ship being flanked by two light houses.  This was 
        a once popular motion simulator ride (yes… motion simulators at the turn 
        of the last century) called <i>A Trip to Rockaway</i>", in which you took 
        a simulated ocean voyage that encountered mechanically produced storms 
        and rolling seas.  </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="circus_ring.jpg" width="640" height="515"></p>
      <p> In the picture below, on the right behind the circus ring was a Pagoda 
        shaped tower marking the end of the <i>Japanese Exposition</i>. Inside 
        was a day nursery for use by mothers who had to bring small children with 
        them to the park.  It included a staff of children’s maids and a baby 
        carriage livery.  </p>
      <p>On the left is <i>The Casino</i> ballroom. In between these two large 
        buildings is a shop that sold Mineral Waters, Italian Ices, and other 
        refreshments.  </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="lights_blue.jpg" width="597" height="387"></p>
      <p>Luna was intended as an adult park (the park sold beer and cigars), but 
        the management did everything possible to help keep children occupied 
        while their parents enjoyed the parks more mature offerings.  </p>
      <p>At the back of the park is the picnic ground. At the very end, in the 
        picture below, we can see the <i>Picnic Pavilion</i>.  
      </p>

      <p>[TRIVIA: Entertainer Bob Hope spent much of his youth at Luna Park.  
        He would often sneak into company picnics and try to win prizes in events 
        such as sack races].  At the far corner, under the piers that held up 
        the Sheiks Tent-like building at the crest of the Chutes ramp, was Luna’s 
        storage warehouse. </p>
