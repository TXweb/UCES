<p>Use much of your cash to reduce the size of your loan.  5% is not a lot, 
        but it is significant when the loan amount is high.  Unfortunately you 
        will not be getting any money from park admissions.  However the default 
        ride/stall prices you are now charging are quite low.  Increasing these 
        prices should bring in good profits. </p>
		<p>Open the Circus to increase your revenue further.  You will have to hire staff.  At the minimum you will need one mechanic and one path sweeper (make sure you set him to water gardens if you want to keep the flowers at the landmark arch and the foot 
        of the lagoon in bloom).</p>
		<p>In real life, people were free to move virtually 
        anywhere in the park (safety standards were different then), especially 
        throughout the main midway.  Therefore, feel free to modify any of the 
        paths.  I do suggest adding more seating, as the only seats currently 
        in the park are those by the bandstand and those on the picnic path. </p>
		<p>To make the peeps more in line with the way they actually were in 1905, 
        they have been configured to enjoy the lower intensity rides, as well 
        as to come to the park on a half-empty stomach.  Although you already 
        have the minimum of amenities (one restroom, one food stall, and one drink 
        stall), adding more should prove profitable.</p>
		
<p>Don’t worry that you have few rides or themes to start with.  A properly funded 
  research team will quickly provide many useful ones.</p>
