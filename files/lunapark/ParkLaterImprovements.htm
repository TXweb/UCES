      <p align="center"> Later Improvements to Luna Park</p>
      <p>Luna was constantly remaking itself to stay fresh, both changing its 
        shows and installing new cutting edge rides.  </p>
	  <p>Players dedicated to building recreations may wish to play the scenario by modeling some of the improvements and changes made to the park.</p>		
      <p><u>1906 - Building the park continues</u></p>
      <p>The park office was moved from its original location next to EDISONIA 
        to a new building next to the entrance archway (between the archway and 
        the Japanese Exposition), and the vacated room would host the <i><a href="incubators.jpg" target="_blank">Infant 
        Incubators</a></i>.  It may sound weird to our ears, but this was an actual 
        hospital run by a doctor to incubate pre-mature babies.  At the time, 
        the medical community did not yet embrace the procedure, so babies were 
        brought to facilities such as this in amusement parks.  For a small fee 
        you could watch the infants being treated, <a

        !</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The concert shell was only located behind the bridge for the parks first 
        year.  It was relocated (along with the <a href="circus_ring.jpg" target="_blank">Circus 
        Ring</a>) into a newly constructed <i><a
href="concert_garden.jpg" target="_blank">Concert Garden</a></i> at the rear of the park by Woodland 
        Avenue. The Concert Garden contained hundreds of bistro tables, and sat 
        between the shrunken picnic grounds and the piers supporting the Chutes 
        ramp. The Concert Garden became so popular that it was soon expanded and 
        renamed the <i>German</i><i> </i><i>Village</i> (the Night and Morning 
        theatre was gutted, and the <a href="plaza.jpg" target="_blank">facade</a> became the 
        entrance gate to the village).</p>
      <p>The Aerial Swing circle swing ride was <a
href="plaza.jpg" target="_blank">moved</a> to the spot where the free Circus Ring was located.</p>
      <p>Where the swing had stood was built a large octagonal <a
href="carousel.jpg" target="_blank">carousel building</a>.  [TRIVIA:  The original carousel was 
        a T.M. Harton Company "menagerie" carved by Daniel Muller.  The original 
        carosel building was replaced in 1915 by PTC #35.  Originally music was 
        provided by a French Gavioli &amp; Company forty-five piece mechanical 
        band organ imported by New York’s Berni Organ Company.  When Luna closed, 
        PTC #35 was sold to Puritas Springs Park on Cleveland’s West Side, and 
        eventually ended up at Six Flags Over Mid-America, Eureka, Missouri.  
        The carousel has been meticulously restored and can be ridden to this 
        day, <a

      <p></p>
<p>In 1906 the Japanese styled entrance to the new ridge-running Scenic 
        Railway roller coaster was built, located by the Japanese Exposition.</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="scenic_railway.jpg" width="526" height="392"></p>
      <p>Extending from the Japanese Exhibition was a suspension bridge to the 
        bottom of the ravine that divided the Luna Park property (the Scenic Railway 
        would later pass underneath it). </p>
      <p>From 1906 onwards air shows were regularly performed in the empty field 
        (yes… 1906!).  Even the best natural aviator in history, Lincoln Beachey, 
        performed a Luna.  This shouldn’t be too surprising however, as Cleveland 
        was always at the forefront of aviation, being home to the Martin Bomber 
        Company (builder of enormous Great War biplane bombers) and host to the 
        Thompson Trophy air races.  In fact, even though air racing had to be 
        suspended years ago due to safety concerns, Cleveland still hosts numerous 
        aviation spectacles.  Years later some of the parks roller coasters would 
        extend into the field across the ravine.  </p>
      <p>A large <i>Hippodrome</i> was built behind the Electric Theater where 
        spectacles of circus elephants and wild-west shows were performed (the 
        entrance was reached via a short path under a <a href="incubators.jpg" target="_blank">large 
        sign</a> between the theatre and the Chutes ramp).  In later years, everything 
        behind the towered façade would be demolished and a massive <a href="dodgem.jpg" target="_blank">roller 
        rink</a> built in their place (the twin towered facade becoming refashioned 
        into the rinks plain looking single towered entrance).  </p>
      <p></p>
<p><u>1907 and beyond</u></p>
      <p> In 1907 a second, street level entrance (serviced by the Woodland Avenue 
        Streetcar) would be built on the roller coaster side of the Picnic Pavilion, 
        so people could enter the park without having to climb the entrance stairs 
        on Ingersoll Road.</p>
      <p>Eventually the Picnic Pavilion was replaced by a massive first-run movie 
        <a
href="theatre.jpg" target="_blank">theater</a> (the Scenitorium had become too small for the purpose) 
        that filled a large portion of the former picnic grounds (by then picnics 
        were mostly held at the bottom of the ravine near the <a href="parking_lot.jpg" target="_blank">swimming 
        facility</a>).</p>
      <p> The Scenitorium Theater proved to be too small, and a <a href="theatre.jpg" target="_blank">larger 
        one</a> was later built in the former picnic grounds at the back of the 
        park (in 1914 the adjoining tower was removed and the old Scenitorium 
        building converted into the <i><a href="hilarity_hall.jpg" target="_blank">Hilarity Hall</a></i> 
        fun house).</p>
      <p>In 1907 the center of the midway at the base of the lagoon hosted the 
        <i><a href="rainbow_dips.jpg" target="_blank">Rainbow Dips</a></i>, an early "magic carpet" 
        style ride. The land around the lagoon became, over time, a concentration 
        of small stalls and covered walkways.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The buildings on the Café side of the main midway were converted over 
        the years into new entertainments such as the 1910 <i>Human Dry Cleaner</i> 
        ride, a pool hall, and numerous fun houses such as 1915’s <i>Cave of the 
        Winds</i>, and <i><a href="belfry.jpg" target="_blank">Belfry for Bats</a> </i>(considered 
        to have been Luna’s best). Even the ever popular Shooting Gallery was 
        eventually given a larger building next door to its original location.</p>
      <p></p>
<p></p>
      <p>In 1912, the corner of Woodland Avenue and Woodhill Road would be the 
        location of the <i><a
href="motorcycle_motordrome.jpg" target="_blank">Motodrome</a></i>, a large stadium built specifically 
        to host the one-year-old (1911) sport of professional motorcycle racing 
        (in later years it would be converted into the home <a href="dancehall.jpg" target="_blank">stadium</a> 
        of the John Carroll University football team).</p>
      <p></p>
<p>In later years Luna developed the lower property.  Improvements included 
        damning the creek above the parking lot (the one inside the billboarded fence) 
        in 1914 to build a swimming beach with wave making machine (yes… wave making!).</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="parking_lot.jpg" width="593" height="419"></p>
      <p align="center"><img src="beach_small.jpg" width="580" height="315">d</p>
      <p>The 1915 PTC designed <i><a href="theatre.jpg" target="_blank">Jack Rabbit</a></i> (PTC 
        #19) would extend along Woodland Avenue, replacing the old wooden side 
        friction Figure Eight coaster. It traveled directly <a
href="theatre.jpg" target="_blank">over</a> the rides out buildings (the small wooded area to 
        the left of the coaster was a pony ride track). </p>
      <p></p>
<p>The shoe and the fun house would be replaced by a large <a href="wheel.jpg" target="_blank">Ferris 
        wheel</a> in 1916 (at which time the smaller 1907 Ferris wheel located 
        elsewhere in the park was dismantled). [TRIVIA: The 1916 Ferris wheel 
        was custom built by the Walter P. Shaw Company and rose 123 feet above 
        the concrete midway.  It supported twelve enclosed cars, each capable 
        of holding a dozen or more people.  At the time of its construction, Cleveland’s 
        Luna Park Ferris wheel was the largest operating Ferris wheel in the United 
        States].</p>
      <p>Luna Park became so popular that the dance hall became too small to host 
        the crowds.  In 1917 the old ballroom called the Casino was demolished 
        and <a href="dancehall.jpg" target="_blank">replaced</a> with a Japanese styled 18,000 
        square foot facility (at the whopping cost of $100,000 dollars).  </p>
      <p></p>
<p>The Rainbow Dips ride proved difficult to maintain, and was replaced 
        in 1918 by a <i><a
href="belfry.jpg" target="_blank">Whip</a></i>.  [TRIVIA: William Mangles was so proud of the 
        Whip installation at Cleveland’s Luna Park that he included it as the 
        example photo in his ride catalog].  </p>
      <p>The 1922 John A. Miller designed <i><a
href="dancehall.jpg" target="_blank">Pippin</a></i> roller coaster would replace the <i>Scenic 
        Railway</i>.</p>
      <p>In front of the Frerris wheel a <a href="dodgem.jpg" target="_blank">Dodgem</a> (bumper 
        cars) was also built in 1922.  </p>
      <p></p>
<p></p>
      <p>When the Pippin was built, the Japanese Exhibition was removed, and beside 
        the Pippin in 1923 was installed one of the very first Hyla Maynes’ <a
href="dancehall.jpg" target="_blank">Caterpillar</a> rides. </p>
      <p>In 1925 Luna removed the Café and installed in its place one of Harry 
        Travers’ earliest <a href="dancehall.jpg" target="_blank">Tumble Bug</a> rides (Luna called 
        theirs the <i>June Bug</i>).  </p>
