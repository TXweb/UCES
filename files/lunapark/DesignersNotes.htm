<tr><td><p align="center">Luna Park - Designer's Notes</p>
<p>I was fortunate in acquiring a measured drawing of the midway at Luna Park.  
  This, combined with the U.S. Geological Survey map for the Shaker Heights Quadrangle, 
  allowed me to layout the park quite accurately.  As Luna Park was constantly 
  expanding and upgrading itself, the choice of the year for the Scenario became 
  an important consideration.  The mid-teens were my first choice, as that is 
  when Luna was at its zenith.  However, in the end I decided on setting the Scenario 
  in 1905.  This is mostly because the layout of the park was still in its testing 
  phase, and therefore looked very different than it would from 1906 onwards (in 
  1906 much of the park was reconfigured, based on lessons learned from that first 
  year).  Unfortunately, although now I had good documentation and a fixed date, 
  the limitations of RCT2 imposed upon me some serious compromises.  </p>
<p>RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 now has more objects/rides 
  available then can be used at the same time.  This is unfortunate, as I would 
  have liked to allow the scenario player the option of having a vast selection 
  of scenery object from which to choose in decorating their park.  I decided 
  therefore to carefully select unique objects to maximize variety.  The new RCT2 
  scenery stacking feature was of immense help in this regard.  For example, I 
  often selected only a half-height wall and eliminated a full-height wall, if 
  two stacked half-height walls would be indistinguishable from the full-height 
  one.  I also chose colorable objects over non-colorable ones, if the colorable 
  object could be colored nearly indistinguishably from the non-colorable one.  
</p>
<p>In the end I actually ended up with less objects than allowed.  I could have 
  chosen to add 3<sup>rd</sup> party created objects, and as a result could have 
  made the park better match the contemporary photos of Luna.  However, unlike 
  a park built just for display purposes, a scenario is intended not to emphasize 
  the creator’s talent so much as to provide a foundation for the players.  If 
  a player has specific 3<sup>rd</sup> party created objects he wants to use, 
  he still has the option of running the scenario back through the scenario editor 
  as a landscape file (don’t forget to save the rides as track-files first) to 
  add them.  These days everyone seems to think that a good looking park can only 
  be made with 3<sup>rd</sup> party objects.  With this particular project, I 
  wanted to show that even with the basic RCT2 objects a reasonably attractive 
  park that gives the feel of a real-life park can still be built.</p>
<p>Another problem I encountered is that a square in RCT2 is approximately 14.68 
  feet.  As walls/roofs must use a full square, this quickly threw building proportions 
  out of whack (many of the Luna Park buildings should have been a half square 
  larger/smaller in their dimensions).  Placing buildings side-by-side, the cumulative 
  effects were becoming intolerable.  I therefore had to look at the big picture, 
  and was forced to intentionally make some buildings slightly smaller or larger.  
  This isn’t that noticeable on the larger buildings, but the tiny buildings (one/two 
  man booths are common to amusement parks, fairgrounds, etceteras) seem absolutely 
  huge.  They also seem much too plain, as many objects I might have wanted to 
  use for building gingerbread were nearly the same size as the buildings I wanted 
  to place them on!</p>
<p>Sign objects turned out to be the biggest annoyance.  There are no three-square 
  wide signs, yet many buildings were three or five squares wide.  Adjacent one-square 
  signs would have worked, but the only one-square wide sign is a scrolling sign!  
  Also, the signs are much too large and they hold too few letters.  I did the 
  best I could with the tools at my disposal.  My goal was to include every sign 
  I could see in the contemporary park photos.  Most Luna Park signs are near 
  where they would have been in real life, although in most examples I had to 
  distill the text to its most basic wording.  Arched and diagonal signs are of 
  course impossible.  The <i>Night and Morning</i> sign should be two diagonals, 
  forming a peak.  I just used a small scrolling sign instead.  The <i>Scenitorium</i> 
  sign should be arched.  I was just going to use a simple single-height sign, 
  but the sign holds only 10 letters, and "Scenitorium" has 11.  I was forced therefore to use the double-height 
  sign and split the lettering.  The billboards along the park fence are real.  
  I was however only able to read the wording on two of the billboards.  The other 
  three billboards I just left blank.  Scenario players can decorate these blank 
  billboards to say anything they would like.</p>
<p>The coloring of signs is unknown.  In fact, color of anything in Luna Park 
  is mostly unknown, as all contemporary photographs are black and white.  The 
  few colored postcards that exist are of little help, as it was the artist who 
  chose the colors.  I primarily chose colors based on a combination of esthetics 
  and written descriptions.</p>
<p>With very few exceptions, RCT2 construction objects can only be placed on a 
  true horizontal/vertical vector with the grid squares.  This caused some careful 
  rethinking of Luna Park, as the land is oddly shaped, and the buildings were 
  situated on the land in a skewed manner.  I finally decided that the Shoot-the-Chutes 
  ramp would be the key, so I squared it up with the grid and adjusted the landscape 
  in reference to it.  The roads of course would look funny, but better jagged 
  roads then jagged buildings.  The roads are 60 foot wide, and I had intended 
  on making the roads using the dashed pavement tiles and placing the Victorian 
  homes scenery objects on the opposite side.  Unfortunately, these tiles looked 
  awful when placed in a jagged manner, and worse still, became stairways when 
  laid down the ravine slope.  I finally decided to forgo the roads altogether.  
  I did however place small signs at the park corners to help orient people as 
  to which road the park fence was abutting.</p>
<p>Much of the midway aligns with the Chutes ramp.  The biggest exception was 
  the landmark arch, and the stairs and midway on either side of it.  This area 
  is turned about 30 degrees in relation to the Chutes ramp.  The solution I chose 
  for this problem was to find the center point of the arch and midway buildings, 
  then spin them to the same alignment as the Chutes ramp.  I then stretched/shrunk 
  and jaggedly offset each building individually to fill the gaps.  Then end result 
  I felt gave the impression of angling away, while still allowing me to use all 
  the scenery objects to actually construct the buildings.</p>
<p>Although when looking at Luna Park 
  from a zoomed out position much of the land heights seem correct, it is actually 
  often off by a several feet from reality.  This is because in many cases I needed 
  land slopes that were twice again as steep or half again as shallow as what 
  RCT2 offers.  A good example is the open field below the trolley loop, where 
  I was forced to put the whole field in a depression rather than to gently lower 
  the height of the field along the distance from the loop to the road.</p>
<p>The last major hurtle was the lack of appropriate track pieces for rides.  
  Although the Chutes ramp is extremely close to the correct length and height, 
  the large loop I was forced to build in order to turn the boats around made 
  the structure above the loop way too wide.  The Scenic River is also incorrect.  
  The lack of eighth-of-a-circle track pieces on the "river rafts" forced me to 
  make the ride protrude too far towards the ravine (in real life the track gracefully 
  curved towards the park boundary fence).  To compensate I had to add an unrealistic 
  bulge of about three squares to the top of the ravine where the ride sits.  
</p>
<p>Anyone who has seen photos of turn of the last century fairs, amusement parks, 
  and exhibitions knows the fondness of the park builders for eclectic architecture, 
  especially architecture with lots of arches.  This is not because the builders 
  new nothing about foreign architecture, but rather because they wanted to create 
  an illusion of the exotic, like in a fairyland.  Unfortunately RCT2 offers very 
  little in the way of doorways, and virtually nothing in the way of archways.  
  As a result, much of the architecture I created for Luna Park had to be squared-off 
  or had to make use of the Castle Style scenery objects.  If someone was willing 
  to make the effort, they can rebuild the Scenario using 3<sup>rd</sup> party 
  scenery objects to give these structures a facelift.</p>
<p>There are many details I tried to incorporate into my recreation of Luna Park, 
  some are known, and some assumed.  The four little tombstones scattered around 
  the midway are real life locations of electrical transformers.  Luna used lots 
  of <a href="lights.jpg" target="_blank">electricity</a>, and it was from these transformers 
  that it was distributed.  The grey circle at the bottom of the staircases surrounded 
  by poles is the trolley car <a href="trolley_loop.jpg" target="_blank">layover loop</a>.  Trolley 
  cars turned into this loop from the middle of Ingersoll 
  Road.  Note that the actual park entrance is not the landmark archway.  Patrons 
  paid to enter at the bottom of the stairway.  The wooden fence on which the 
  billboards are hung actually extended around the entire perimeter of the park.  
  I chose to just use the default park boundary fence instead of extending this 
  wooden fence.  Just remember that the RCT2 park boundary fence in the corner 
  between the trolley depot on Ingersoll Road and the 
  edge of the wooden fence on Woodhill Road is not supposed 
  to exist.  </p>
<p>All the trees in the main portion of the park are as close to reality, as far 
  as position and shape, as I could determine from pictures (although with actual 
  tree species I was limited to what RCT2 had available).  The trees on the slope 
  of the ravine however are just randomly placed to give the feeling of thick 
  brush.  It may look unnatural to have an open field next to a heavily wooded 
  slope, but this is typical of the landscape in Cleveland.  </p>
<p>The small outcropping building behind the Café is the kitchen.  The shooting 
  gallery used real .22 caliber rifles, and was by necessity iron lined.  I used 
  the metal wall objects to simulate this. Most of the "flat" roofs were actually 
  slightly humped to shed water/snow.  I suggested this by using roof tiles of 
  a slightly different texture in the middle of the flat roofs as compared to 
  the sides.  There is a mural on the wall of the <i>Night and Morning</i> theatre, 
  which I tried to suggest by using different colored wall tiles.  I also used 
  two different shades of blue to suggest the mural on the side of the <i>EDISONIA</i>.  
  The plaster mountain next to <i>Chateau Alphonse</i> I simulated using the rock 
  wall, and I then placed wooden support poles behind the wall to give the illusion 
  that the wall was fake.  </p>
<p>The tower beside the Scenitorium is supposed to be 
  wider than any of the tower scenery objects I had available.  As this tower 
  contained the old Taffy Shop, I saw a good opportunity to incorporate an RCT 
  shop.  I chose the Candy Apple Stall, as it has a large stick that is sort of 
  tower like.  Just imagine that both the tower and stall are one integrated unit.  
  Again the Japanese Exhibition provided another opportunity to include an RCT 
  stall.  I chose the Cold Persimmon Punch (sujongkwa) 
  stall to end the Exhibition row, as it had an appropriate roof architecture 
  for the location.</p>
<p>The <i>Scenic River</i> building in real life would have touched both the Figure 
  Eight coaster and the Casino.  The slight gap between these buildings is an 
  artifact of both straightening the alignment of these buildings and the extra 
  width imposed by the "river rafts" track.  Originally the façade was a giant 
  arch.  However, arches are one of the objects least supported by RCT2.  I therefore 
  decided to create a facade more along the lines of how the ride looked when 
  it was remodeled as the Mystic Caverns.  The carpentry shop in the back of the 
  building is realistic, but I don’t have any evidence as to what the back of 
  the building actually looked like.  The shop skylight possibly did not exist, 
  but it could have, and it certainly makes the building look more esthetically 
  pleasing.  The water wheel did exist, but not where I have placed it (I thought 
  it looked more interesting to us, the game players, to actually be able to see 
  the wheel turning).  The out buildings contained <a
href="buster.jpg" target="_blank">dioramas</a>, such as a scene with Buster Brown and his dog 
  Tag.  In real life the passages through which the ride tracks entered into the 
  buildings would have been smaller.  The large openings I was forced to use make 
  the buildings seem empty, so I filled the visible areas with some random scenery 
  objects to give the illusion that there was something special going on inside.  
  I don’t know how many vehicles the ride originally had, so I chose a number 
  that gave both good spacing and efficient people moving.</p>
      <p>I am extremely pleased with the <i>Figure Eight</i> side-friction roller coaster.  
        Although the photographic evidence was slim, I was lucky to have an overhead 
        drawing.  Unlike other figure eight coasters, such as Lakemont Parks Leap-the-Dips, 
        the two loop stacks were offset from each other.  By coincidence, this 
        proved an ideal condition for the RCT2 track pieces.  I did not have to 
        make any compromises (other than the normal one of staggered drops, due 
        to their not being any glide slope track in RCT2), and the footprint taken 
        up by the coaster is almost exactly the same as Luna’s <i>Figure Eight</i> 
        had in real life.  Note some of the differences between my Figure Eight 
        and Steve Frank’s excellent Leap-the-Dips @ Lakemont Park figure eight.  
        Ignoring the fact that Steve’s coaster is slightly bigger (this is an 
        artifact of RCT2 and the compromises Steve had to make due to the lack 
        of appropriate track parts), the most noticeable difference is that Luna’s 
        Figure Eight <a href="brake_run.jpg" target="_blank">brake run</a> passes 
        underneath the loop stack.  Luna’s figure eight service building also 
        extends at an angle from the corner of the station into the middle of 
        the loop stack, whereas in Steve’s Leap-the-Dips it extends from the center 
        of the station.  Luna’s station was a simple flat roofed affair.  There 
        was also a roof over the brake run to keep the brakes dry.  I do not know 
        how many cars were on the ride.  I made the assumption that no more than 
        one car would be climbing the lift hill at the same time.  Therefore, 
        assuming maximum efficiency, four cars seemed to be a good number (as 
        the last car leaves the station, the first one arrives).  This was fortunate, 
        as it meant I did not have to make any compromises to accommodate a long 
        station platform.  Instead of the usual cupola above the top of the lift 
        hill as there is on the Leap-the-Dips, Luna’s Figure Eight used a single 
        trellis arch of lights (like the <a href="lights.jpg" target="_blank">light 
        trellises</a> on the roof of the Casino and Café that I am simulating 
        with the white railing scenery object).  As there is no suitable RCT scenery 
        object (the white railing object wouldn’t work here), I chose to just 
        leave it off.  I don’t know if there was a bunny hop just before the break 
        run.  However as this was almost universal on other figure eight roller 
        coasters (and remember this was the worlds largest figure eight roller 
        coaster), I decided to include it on Luna’s coaster.  Scenery around the 
        coaster also got special treatment.  The tree in the middle of the front 
        loop stack is realistic.  A portrait taken behind the coaster reveals 
        a large jagged rock and also a thin tree growing next to the rear loop 
        stack.  By coincidence the jagged shape and size of the rock is very similar 
        to that of the broken Egyptian Pillar object, so I used the pillar as 
        a close substitute.</p>
      <p>Errata: A few of the wall pieces that are touching the park boundary 
        fence (specifically the lowest wall on the storage shed) can NOT be destroyed, 
        as the game considers them to be on the outside of the fence. This is 
        not that big a deal, as you probably will not destroy these structures; 
        and even if you do the wall panel that cannot be destroyed just functions 
        as an opaque regular-height boundary fence. <br>
