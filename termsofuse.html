Welcome to the UCES public site.  This site, and the forums, are provided to help you get as much entertainment as possible from the UCES project. 

<p>Our terms of use follow the guidelines of common courtesy.  Please respect other people and stay on-topic. 

<p><b>Forum Use Rules:</b><br>

The purpose of the forums is to support and discuss the UCES.  It is not a general purpose board.  Posts that are "off-topic" may be deleted by a moderator.

<p>The following are prohibited: vulgar language, harassment of other users, "flaming", spamming, racial or ethnic slurs, sexism, or slander. 

<p>Do not use inappropriate images on our forums - ones endorsing pornography, software piracy; or those that "slam" any individual or company. Please do not publicly re-post private email without the express written permission of the e-mail's originator. 

<p>Do not publicly re-post private discussions with others that were held over messaging clients without permission from all the other owners (participants) of the messages. Please refrain from having personal discussions with other board members on the forums; there are e-mail and Internet messaging programs for that purpose. Do not attempt to impersonate other forum members, and/or forum moderators/administrators. This is an offense that will get you banned from the forums. 

<p>Out of courtesy to other forum users and our moderators we expect you to use only one username on our forums. Please do not post email addresses, standard addresses, ICQ and other messaging client numbers, or phone numbers which are not your own.  This activity will get you banned from our forums..

<p>Any user whose posting privileges are revoked is subject to immediate ban if/when caught posting under another username.

<p>UCES takes no responsibility for the content, attachments, links to, or use of the content of the messages posted on this board, nor do we endorse the opinions of the authors. 

<p>While we take no responsibility for the content of the messages posted on this board, our moderators may review messages posted here to make certain that they meet our guidelines as stated in this document. We reserve the right to delete any message for any reason, at our sole discretion or the discretion of our appointed moderators. 

<p>These rules may change at any time, with no notice posted anywhere except this page. Please check these rules before posting any future messages to our boards.

<p>If you do not like these rules, please do not post. Thank you for your attention and cooperation.
